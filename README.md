# login_register_form_php

Welcome to my very first PHP Project

This project I decided to do a login and register form project. Where you are given two forms which is a login and a register form. All you have to do is register by filling out the four form fields. Which are username, password, first name and last name. Then you will be prompted with one of two options. A success message to click a button to login or if there are any errors you will be then given a message to go back and fix your mistake. Once you get the correct message you can then login and then be greeted by your first and last name. Followed by a log out button to end your session.
